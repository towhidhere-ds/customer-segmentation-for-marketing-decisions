## Customer Segmentation for Marketing Decisions

### Overview

This project focuses on segmenting customers using unsupervised machine learning to support data-driven marketing decisions. By grouping customers with similar behaviors and characteristics, the analysis helps businesses understand who their customers are and how to engage them more effectively.

### Business Problem

Marketing teams often treat all customers the same, which leads to wasted budget and weak engagement. The goal of this project is to identify distinct customer segments and translate those insights into practical marketing strategies that improve targeting, personalization, and ROI.

### Dataset

The dataset contains customer demographic and behavioral attributes, including household composition, age indicators, and spending-related features. Data was cleaned and prepared to ensure reliable clustering results.

### Methodology

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature scaling
* Unsupervised learning using clustering techniques
* Cluster evaluation and interpretation
* Customer profiling based on cluster characteristics

### Key Insights

Each cluster represents a distinct customer group, such as:

* Family-oriented households prioritizing value and convenience
* Younger parents focused on quality and child-related products
* High-income customers interested in premium offerings
* Cost-conscious families driven by discounts and bulk purchasing

### Marketing Recommendations

For every customer segment, tailored marketing strategies were proposed, including:

* Product bundling and promotions
* Channel selection (digital vs traditional)
* Loyalty and pricing strategies

These recommendations connect model outputs directly to real business actions.

### Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas / NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

### Outcome

This project demonstrates the full analytical workflow, from raw data to business insight, with a strong emphasis on storytelling and decision-making rather than just model metrics.
